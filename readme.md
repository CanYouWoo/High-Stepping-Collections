This is the High Stepping Collections Online Boutique
This was created for my Code Louisville FEWD class as it relates to the courses and materials learned while in this class.

The features included for my project are:


1. 2 Media Queries - one that changes the layout of the screen when reduced less than 600px and the other adds a toggle menu when the screen size is reduced to 800px. Then menu disappears until you click the short menu either on or off. I also used Flex properties when re-arranging the items upon the size (mobile first approach). 

2. CSS navigation with contains a hamburger menu that is displayed when viewing mobile. 
    2a. Flexbox was used on my containers to rearrange the page when the different sizing of the screen is invoked.
    2b. There are some hoover features implemented on the buttoms and images at the bottom

3. 2 Javascript functions - One that toggles on and off the menu in mobile mode and the other that turns on and of a sizing guide when the button is clicked.

4. Bootstrap CDN was used to showcase a rating system as a means to show what a customer would rate the product.

**Please note this is a shell and pages for the links have not been created.**
**All PluralSight Courses have been completed, for some reason my Interactive courses are not showing that I've completed them.**
